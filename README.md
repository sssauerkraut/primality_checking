# primality_checking

This repository contains laboratory work #2 as part of a third-year Number-theoretic methods in cryptography course at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU). The project implements three probabilistic tests for checking the primality of numbers: Fermat, Solovey-Strassen, and Miller-Rabin.

## Description

The project provides implementations of three classic probabilistic primality tests:

1. **Fermat's Test** - based on Fermat's Little Theorem
2. **Solovey-Strassen Test** - uses the Jacobi symbol
3. **Miller-Rabin Test** - the most robust probabilistic test

All algorithms are implemented strictly in accordance with their formal descriptions from studybook Makhovenko_E_B_-_Teoretiko-chislovye_metody_v_kriptografii
